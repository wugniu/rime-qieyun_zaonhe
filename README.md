# 推導上海話

℞ **wugniu/rime-qieyun_zaonhe**

Inspired by <https://github.com/ayaka14732/rime-kyonh>.

The sinograph readings in `*.dict.yaml` files are completely programmatically extrapolated from *qieyun*-style Middle Chinese.

Extrapolation rules can be found here, <https://github.com/nk2028/qieyun-examples/blob/main/zaonhe.js>.
